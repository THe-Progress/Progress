# Progress Project

Welcome to our group project, Progress. It's an Android app designed to combat procrastination using machine learning, customized notifications, and a reward system. Currently, we have completed the onboarding portion using flutter .

## Onboarding

During onboarding, users can select from a variety of activities that will be used later in generating notification. This is implemented by the `ActivitySelection` class in [`main.dart`](progress/lib/main.dart).

## Key Components

- `main.dart`: This file contains the `ActivitySelection` widget along with other basic onboarding pages. `ActivitySelection` allows users to select and deselect activities during onboarding.

- `mainapp.dart`: This is the main app widget. Currently it displays the selected activities in a list but it will be our main portion after the onboarding is done.

As we progress, we'll be adding more features and functionalities to combat procrastination effectively.
